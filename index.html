            <p>Neflix stated that, "Season 1 immediately thrusts viewers into the middle of the war-ridden land of Ravka. The nation is divided by the menacing Shadow Fold, a miles-wide, towering wall of horrific darkness filled with volcra — winged monsters that feast on human flesh" (Bitran 2023). </p>

            <h2>What is Shadow and Bones</h2>
            <p>Neflix stated that, "Season 1 immediately thrusts viewers into the middle of the war-ridden land of Ravka. The nation is divided by the menacing Shadow Fold, a miles-wide, towering wall of horrific darkness filled with volcra — winged monsters that feast on human flesh. According to legend, the Black Heretic created the Fold hundreds of years ago, and the bifurcation of Ravka led to years of war on multiple fronts: a military conflict with Fjerda, the nation to the north that is inspired by Scandinavia, and a trade war with Shu Han, the nation to the south that is inspired by East Asia. Ravkan soldiers range from First Army otkazat'sya, who lack special powers, and Grisha, who are part of General Kirigan’s elite second army and practice what’s known as small science, the art of manipulating matter. The Grisha train at the luxurious Little Palace in Ravka’s capital. Meanwhile, Kaz’s Crown Club is oceans away on the isle of Kerch, where gangs battle it out in the city of Ketterdam’s Barrel" (Bitran 2023).</p>
